This brief examines the 2023 demographic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau covering race, ethnicity, and age.  This brief also covers 2023 estimates from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey (ACS) on a range of important topics such as educational attainment, poverty, and housing costs.   In 2023, the official definition of the New Orleans metro area changed to exclude St. Tammany. Later this year, when the Census Bureau releases 2023 ACS data, we'll publish data according to the new 7-parish metro area definition.
</div>

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 962,165 residents were living in
the 7-parish New Orleans metro as of July 2023, a 4.5 percent decrease
from April 2020.1 The metro area now has 84 percent of its 2000
population of1,146,458. In this brief, we examine demographic data
released by the U.S. Census Bureau and identify important changes in
metro area parishes since 2000 (or the best benchmark available).

## Race/Ethnicity {#raceethnicity}

Compared to 2000, pre-Katrina, there are now 120,876 fewer Black
residents living in New Orleans (Orleans Parish), and there are 23,503
fewer White residents as well as 14,531 more Hispanic residents.2

### What is Orleans Parish? 

Orleans Parish is the city of New Orleans. New Orleans and Orleans Parish are interchangeable. Their boundaries are the same, and they contain the same population. 
</div>

In Orleans Parish, the share of the 2023 population that is Black —
while lower than in 2000 when it was 67 percent — continues to represent
the majority of city residents at 56 percent. The share of Hispanic
residents in the city increased from 3 percent in 2000 to8 percent in
2023; the share of Asian residents increased from 2 percent to 3
percent; and the share of White residents increased from 28 percent to
31 percent. Meanwhile, Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations increased
as a share of the total population in Jefferson, St. Bernard,
St. Charles, and St. John the Baptist parishes. In fact, the number and
share of Hispanics have increased in all seven parishes in the metro
area since 2000.

Between 2000 and 2023, the number of Hispanics in Jefferson Parish more
than doubled – reaching 79,805 or more than 19 percent of the total
parish population. In Orleans and St. Bernard parishes, the Hispanic
population nearly doubled – growing to 29,563 (8% of the population) in
Orleans and 6,206 (14% of the population) in St. Bernard. The number of
Hispanics St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, Plaquemines, and St. James
more than doubled reaching 4,231, 3,788, 2,250, and 395 respectively.

As of July2023, there were 126,238Hispanics in the metro area,
representing 13 percent of the metro population. This is up from 2000
when there were 53,947 Hispanics, representing 5 percent of the metro
population. Despite these recent gains, the Hispanic share of the
population in metro area parishes is below the average for the United
States, which has grown from 13 percent to 19 percent of the total U.S.
population over these 23years.

\#updated Text

The number of Hispanics in the New Orleans metro has continued to swell
in recent years. From 2010 to 2020, the Hispanic population accounted
for the vast majority of the metro area’s growth, increasing by 44,136,
while the overall population increased by only 51,149. Since 2020, the
overall metro population declined but the Hispanic population continued
to grow. From 2020 to 2023, the metro area gained another 894 Hispanic
residents while losing a net total of 45,110 residents.

Hispanic is an umbrella term comprising multiple nationalities and
ethnicities. Researchers have shown that most Hispanics prefer to
identify by nationality rather than by pan-ethnic terms such as
“Hispanic” and “Latino.”[^1] The nationalities of Hispanics residing in
metro New Orleans are quite distinct from the national Hispanic profile.

In 2023, the largest Hispanic group in metro New Orleans was Honduran,
representing 29 percent of the Hispanic population. In comparison,
Hondurans represent only 2 percent of the national Hispanic population.
These figures point to metro New Orleans as a hub of Honduran migration.

Not to be ignored, the Mexican population represents 16 percent of the
Hispanic population in metro New Orleans. Nevertheless, the Mexican
population is much less prominent in the metro than nationally, where it
represents 58 percent of the Hispanic population.

## Population by age and household types {#population-by-age-and-household-types}

The progression of the baby boomers through the age groups, along with
falling birth rates, has brought massive changes to the metro — and
indeed the whole country — with many more changes yet to come.[^2]
Looking at the total population in the metro by five-year age groups for
2000 and 2023, the baby boomers are like a demographic tidal wave.
According to the American Community Survey, the median age of the metro
has risen to 40 in 2023 from 34.8 in 2000.

Meanwhile, the share of households with children is shrinking while the
share of individuals living alone is growing — both across the metro and
nation. As of 2023 ,22 percent of households in Metro New Orleans
included children, down from 33 percent in 2000. Between 2000 and 2023,
the percent of Jefferson households with children declined from 33
percent to 23 percent; and the percent of Orleans households with
children declined from 30 percent to 20 percent.

As households with children have declined, the share of single-person
households has grown in the metro and nationwide. The metro area share
of individuals living alone grew from 28 percent in 2000 to 36 percent
in 2023 — similar to the trend for Jefferson Parish where the share of
householders living alone grew from 27 percent to 34 percent. The
increase was larger in Orleans Parish, which jumped from 33 to 42
percent.

Overall the youth population is substantially lower than pre-Katrina
levels. The metro had 303,054 children under 18 years in 2000 and only
206,918 in 2023. More than half of this loss was driven by Orleans
Parish, where the population under 18 has declined to 70,990 from
129,167. Jefferson Parish’s child population also declined from 114,849
to 93,320. The under 18 population is now 22 percent of the metro
population, down from 27 percent in 2000.

### Where is data for Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. James, St. Charles, and St. John the Baptist?

Although race/ethnicity and age data is available for all eight parishes in metro New Orleans, most other demographic data (such as educational attainment, poverty, and homeownership) is available for only the three most populous parishes of Jefferson, Orleans, and St. Tammany, as well as the metro.
</div>

## Educational attainment, income, and employment {#educational-attainment-income-and-employment}

Educational attainment is an important determinant of household incomes,
workforce skills, and regional resiliency.[^3] In New Orleans, 45
percent of adults 25 and older had at least a bachelor’s degree in 2023
— higher than the U.S. average of 36 percent, and up from 26 percent in
2000. The Jefferson Parish share of adults with a bachelor’s degree is
30 percent up from 21 percent in 2000. Overall the share of adults with
a bachelor’s degree in Metro New Orleans from 22to 35 percent — just
short of the national average of 36 percent.

The share of New Orleans adults who have a bachelor’s degree has grown
across racial and ethnic groups since 1980. But while 72 percent of
White adults in New Orleans have a bachelor’s, only 47 percent of Asian
adults, NA percent of Hispanic adults, and 27 percent of Black adults in
New Orleans have a bachelor’s as of 2023.

The metro area increase in the share of adults with a bachelor’s degree
or higher has been coupled with a decline in the share of adults with
less than a high school degree. The proportion of adults 25 years and
older with less than a high school education declined across Orleans,
Jefferson, and the metro as a whole. The metro share of adults without a
high school degree fell from 23 percent in 2000 to 12 ’percent in 2023
2023. In Jefferson Parish, 14 percent of adults 25 and older have less
than a high school degree while in New Orleans only 9 percent of adults
have less than a high school degree – lower than the national average.

In 1979, households with higher incomes were disproportionately in the
parishes surrounding New Orleans, while lower income White, Hispanic,
and Black households were more likely to live in the city.5 By 2023,
these patterns had changed with higher income White households more
often living in the city such that income disparity within the city has
escalated. In 2023, Black households in New Orleans had a median income
of only $38,092, while Hispanic households were at $56,992 and White
households at $97,494.

across the metro have a median income of 4.0841^{4}, which is well below
their national peers (5.3927^{4}). And Asian households in Metro New
Orleans have a median income of 6.8079^{4} which is about 40% lower than

Employment rates indicate the percent of the working age population that
did any work for pay, including self-employment. Employment rates are a
more comprehensive measure of labor market conditions than official
“unemployment” rates, because they not only reveal the share of the
population that are unemployed but also those who are no longer in the
labor force at all—many of whom are “discouraged workers.”6 Employment
rates by race and gender suggest the extent to which structural economic
changes have benefited different groups. In New Orleans, employment
rates have risen for White men and women, Hispanic men and women, and
Black women compared with 1980, but for Black men are lower in 2023 at
58 percent than in 1980 when 63 percent of working age Black men had
employment.

## Poverty and access to vehicles and internet {#poverty-and-access-to-vehicles-and-internet}

A high share of residents living below the poverty level indicates the
economy is not providing many residents with the ability to meet their
most basic needs, including food, housing, and transportation. The
poverty rate in New Orleans decreased from 28 to 23 percent between 1999
and 2023while the Jefferson Parish poverty rate increased from 14 to
17percent. Across the U.S., the poverty rate increased by one percentage
point between 1999 and 2023.

### How is poverty measured? 

The Census still uses the federal definition for poverty that was first created in 1964. The original calculations were based on studies from the early 1960s that indicated that family food costs were about one-third of a family’s budget. But housing costs have risen much faster than food costs since 1964. Also, the current calculations don’t count non-cash government aid, like Child Tax Credits or housing subsidies, as income. And they aren’t adjusted for differences in costs of living in different parts of the country. Given these limitations, the Census began publishing a Supplemental Poverty Measure that incorporates up-to-date data on regional housing costs as well as several kinds of government aid.  According to the Census, the 2020 Supplemental Poverty Rate for the U.S. was 9.1 percent. The Official Poverty Rate that same year was 11.4 percent.[^8]  The Census Bureau does not calculate Supplemental Poverty Rates for geographies smaller than the nation as a whole.[^9]
</div>

The poverty rate for Black New Orleanians spiked when the 1980s “oil
bust” hit, jumping from 37% in 1979 to 42% in 1989. White New Orleanians
were not similarly affected. The poverty rate for White New Orleanians
remained at roughly 12% in 1979 and in 1989. In 2023, the poverty rate
for White New Orleanians was 11 percent, while the poverty rate for
Black New Orleanians had fallen to 30% but remained about triple that of
White New Orleanians.

Post-Katrina, the share of New Orleans households without access to a
vehicle dropped from 27 percent in 2000 to 18 percent in 2023.
Nonetheless, at 18 percent, New Orleans’ share is higher than in
neighboring parishes, indicating the importance of a robust public
transportation system and comprehensive evacuation plan.

Internet access is an important indicator of access to information.
Studies have shown that without broadband, computer access, and
encompassing technology training services, workers and students are at a
disadvantage in the job market and education system.[^4] Only 76 percent
of households in Orleans Parish and only 72 percent of households in
Jefferson Parish are connected to the internet through a home-based
internet service, such as broadband (cable, DSL, or fiber), satellite,
or dial-up service, compared to 80 percent nationwide. Internet access
without a subscription refers to households that only have access
through group access locations such as school, work, a library, or
coffee shop.

An increasingly common way to access the internet is through a
smartphone or some other cellular device. While, in general, smartphone
access contributes positively to lessening the Digital Divide, having
access only through a smartphone restricts ability to fully leverage the
internet to complete common tasks such as writing and researching a
resume, registering your kids for school, analyzing data about your
neighborhood, or creating content for an internet business. In Orleans
Parish, 13 percent of households only have access through a smartphone,
compared to 12 percent nationwide.

## Foreign-born population and geographic mobility {#foreign-born-population-and-geographic-mobility}

A rising foreign-born share of the population may reflect expanding
economic opportunities for both high-skilled and low-skilled
workers.[^5] That share of the population has grown in Orleans,
Jefferson, and across the metro as whole since 2000, led by a 6.5
percentage point gain in Jefferson Parish. By 2023, fully 14 percent of
Jefferson Parish population was foreign-born, similar to the U.S. share.
In Orleans Parish the foreign-born share of the population increased by
2.5 percentage points between 2000 and 2023.

Like the foreign-born population, a rising share of the population who
moved into Orleans Parish in the past year may reflect expanding
economic opportunities. The most frequent reason people move long
distances, such as from one state to another state, is for job
opportunities.[^6] In addition, the young and well-educated are more
likely than others to move long distances.[^7] In 2023, 5 percent of the
population in Orleans Parish had moved into the parish in the past year,
up from 3 percent in 2004. Over 65 percent of the new movers into
Orleans Parish came from outside the state of Louisiana. In Jefferson
Parish, the share of the population who were new movers into the parish
was 5 percent in 2004 and has not significantly changed.

## Homeownership {#homeownership}

Homeownership rates across the U.S. have fallen since 2000 from 66 to 65
percent in 2023. Homeownership rates in New Orleans have increased from
46 percent in 2000 to 56 percent in 2023, but remain lower than the
metro as a whole where 63 percent of households are homeowners.

Homeownership rates among Black householders in New Orleans made
consistent progress between 1970 and 2023, increasing from 27 percent to
50 percent. Still, the difference in homeownership rates between Black
and White people in 2023 was significant, with only 50 percent of Black
householders in New Orleans owning their homes compared to 64 percent of
White householders.

Metro homeownership rates roughly mirror national rates, with just over
63 percent of all householders owning their homes and White
homeownership rates about 24 percentage points higher than rates for
Black homeownership. This disparity is smaller in Orleans Parish, where
only 64 percent of White householders own their homes—14 percentage
points higher than Black householders. Homeownership in Jefferson
outstrips Orleans with 63 percent of all householders owning their home.
But this is driven by a higher White homeownership rate of 78 percent
which is 33 percentage points higher than for Black householders in
Jefferson Parish.

Homeowners without a mortgage own their homes free and clear of any type
of loan. A high share of such homeowners usually indicates residents
living in the same house for long periods of time and helps shield
neighborhoods from foreclosures. The proportion of metro area homeowners
without a mortgage has increased from 36 to 46 percent between 2000 and
2023, driven by changes in Orleans and Jefferson. The share of
homeowners without a mortgage jumped from 33 to 44 percent in Orleans
and from 35 to 46 percent in Jefferson.

## Housing costs and affordability, housing stock, and commuting {#housing-costs-and-affordability-housing-stock-and-commuting}

High housing costs can limit a region’s ability to attract and retain
the workforce essential for a healthy economy.[^8] Severe housing cost
burdens of more than 50 percent of household income indicate a serious
problem in housing affordability. In 2004, the share of severely
cost-burdened renters in New Orleans and the U.S. was 24 and 24 percent,
respectively. In the 19 years since, that share has spiked to 34 percent
in Orleans while growing to only 26 percent nationally. In Jefferson
Parish, the share of renters paying more than 50 percent of household
income on housing and utilities is 32 percent in 2023.

The share of homeowners paying more than 50 percent of household income
on their mortgage, taxes, utilities, and insurance is only 13 percent
across the metro area. There is a clear gap between the rate of housing
cost burden for renters vs. homeowners, and that gap has widened.

The surge in the share of severely cost-burdened renters in New Orleans
is reflective of the surge in the median gross rent (rent plus
utilities) in the city. From 2004 to 2023, monthly rent plus utilities
rose from $917to $1,203 in New Orleans, a 31 percent increase after
adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, median gross rents increased 25
percent nationwide.

America’s aging housing stock represents both a potential problem and an
opportunity. Older homes are less energy-efficient and more expensive to
maintain.[^9] Moreover, research has shown that lead poisoning in
children is correlated strongly with residing in pre-1950 homes.[^10]
Conversely, in New Orleans, many older homes are protected by
preservation laws that have helped retain the historic character of the
city.

In Orleans Parish, fully 37 percent of all housing units are in pre-1950
structures. Meanwhile, in Jefferson Parish, 71 percent of the housing
stock was built in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and just 21
percent of housing stock has been built since 1990.

A metro region is partially defined by the commuting patterns of its
residents. Nationwide and across Metro New Orleans, there has been a
sizable increase in people working from home since the COVID-19 pandemic
struck. In New Orleans, the share working at home rose from 3 percent in
2000 to 16 percent in 2023, while the share using public transportation
declined sharply from 14 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2023. Working
from home is somewhat less common in Jefferson (7 percent) than in New
Orleans or across the nation (14 percent).

## Data Sources / Methodology {#data-sources-methodology}

Data on race/ethnicity and age is from the Census Bureau vintage 2023
population estimates and Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1). Other
demographic data is from the Census 2000 Summary File 3 (SF3) and
American Community Survey 2004, and 2023 (single-year files).

Statistical tests of significance were computed at the 95% confidence
level for all data from the American Community Survey and Census 2000
SF3. An “\*” indicates that differences between two time periods or
geographies are not significant, and therefore are the result of
sampling variability rather than real change in characteristics of the
population.

The significance tests require both estimates and their standard errors.
Standard errors for the ACS estimates were calculated using formulas
from section seven, “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical
Significance” available at:
<https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 SF3 data were calculated using formulas
from Chapter 8 of the Technical Documentation available at:
<https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2000/technical-documentation/complete-tech-docs/summary-files/sf3.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 and Census 2010 SF1 data are zero.
