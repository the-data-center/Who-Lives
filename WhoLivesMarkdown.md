This brief examines the 2021 demographic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau covering race, ethnicity, and age. For results of the official 2020 Census headcount see our analyses under https://www.datacenterresearch.org/topic/population-demographics/.  This brief also covers 2021 estimates from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey (ACS) on a range of important topics such as educational attainment, poverty, and housing costs.
</div>

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 1,261,726 residents were living in
metro New Orleans as of July 2021, a 6 percent increase from April
2010.[^1] The metro area now has 94 percent of its 2000 population of
1,337,726. In this brief, we examine demographic data released by the
U.S. Census Bureau and identify important changes in metro area parishes
since 2000 (or the best benchmark available).

## Race/Ethnicity {#raceethnicity}

According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2021 population estimates, there
are now 103,048 fewer Black residents living in New Orleans (Orleans
Parish) compared to 2000, and there are -11,133 more White residents as
well as 6,661 more Hispanic residents.[^2]

### What is Orleans Parish? 

Orleans Parish is the city of New Orleans. New Orleans and Orleans Parish are interchangeable. Their boundaries are the same, and they contain the same population. 
</div>

In Orleans Parish, the share of the 2021 population that is Black —
while lower than in 2000 when it was 67 percent — continues to represent
the majority of city residents at 58 percent. The share of Hispanic
residents in the city increased from 3 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in
2021; the share of Asian residents increased from 2 percent to 3
percent; and the share of White increased from 27 percent to 31 percent.
Meanwhile, Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations increased as a share
of the total population in Jefferson, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John
the Baptist, and St. Tammany parishes. In fact, the number and share of
Hispanics have increased in all eight parishes in the metro area since
2000.

</div>

Between 2000 and 2021, the number of Hispanics in Jefferson Parish
increased by 33,789 reaching over 15 percent of the total parish
population. Orleans Parish and St. Tammany Parish gained 6,661 and
12,046 Hispanics, respectively, such that the Hispanic share of the
population grew to 6 percent in Orleans and 6 percent in St. Tammany by
2021.

As of July 2021, there were 118,295 Hispanics in the metro area,
representing 9 percent of the metro population. This is up from 2000
when there were 58,545, representing 4 percent of the metro population.
Despite these recent gains, the Hispanic share of the population in
metro area parishes is below the average for the United States, which
has grown from 13 percent to 19 percent of the total U.S. population
over these 21 years.

The number of Hispanics in the New Orleans metro has grown every year
since 2006. Indeed, while the overall metro population has grown 6
percent since 2010, the Hispanic population has grown 28 percent such
that Hispanics account for 36 percent of the metro’s population growth
since 2010.

Hispanic is an umbrella term comprising multiple nationalities and
ethnicities. Researchers have shown that most Hispanics prefer to
identify by nationality rather than by pan-ethnic terms such as
“Hispanic” and “Latino.”[^3] The nationalities of Hispanics residing in
metro New Orleans are quite distinct from the national Hispanic profile.

In 2021, the largest Hispanic group in metro New Orleans was Honduran,
representing 32 percent of the Hispanic population. In comparison,
Hondurans represent only 2 percent of the national Hispanic population.
These figures point to metro New Orleans as a hub of Honduran migration.

Not to be ignored, the Mexican population represents 13 percent of the
Hispanic population in metro New Orleans. Nevertheless, the Mexican
population is much less prominent in the metro than nationally, where it
represents 60 percent of the Hispanic population.

## Population by age and household types {#population-by-age-and-household-types}

The progression of the baby boomers through the age groups, along with
falling birth rates, has brought massive changes to the metro — and
indeed the whole country — with many more changes yet to come.[^4]
Looking at the total population in the metro by five-year age groups for
2000 and 2021, the baby boomers are like a demographic tidal wave.
Consequently, the median age of the metro has risen to 38.8 in 2021 from
34.8 in 2000.

Meanwhile, the share of households with children is shrinking while the
share of individuals living alone is growing — both across the metro and
nation. As of 2021, 24 percent of households in metro New Orleans
included children, down from 34 percent in 2000. Between 2000 and 2021,
the percent of St. Tammany households with children declined from 40
percent to 31 percent; the percent of Jefferson households with children
declined from 33 percent to 24 percent; and the percent of Orleans
households with children declined from 30 percent to 19 percent.

As households with children have declined, the share of single-person
households has grown in the metro and nationwide. The metro area share
of individuals living alone grew from 27 percent in 2000 to 34 percent
in 2021 — similar to the trend for Jefferson Parish where the share of
householders living alone grew from 27 percent to 33 percent. The
increase was larger in Orleans Parish, which jumped from 33 to 45
percent.

While the metro has regained much of the post-Katrina population losses,
youth population is substantially lower than pre-Katrina levels. The
metro had 358,092 children under 18 years in 2000 and only 279,805 in
2021. Much of this loss was driven by Orleans Parish, where the
population under 18 has declined to 74,460 from 129,408. The under 18
population is now 22 percent of the metro population, down from 27
percent in 2000.

### Where is data for Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. James, St. Charles, and St. John the Baptist?

Although race/ethnicity and age data is available for all eight parishes in metro New Orleans, most other demographic data (such as educational attainment, poverty, and homeownership) is available for only the three most populous parishes of Jefferson, Orleans, and St. Tammany, as well as the metro.
</div>

## Educational attainment, income, and internet access {#educational-attainment-income-and-internet-access}

Educational attainment is an important determinant of household incomes,
workforce skills, and regional resiliency.[^5] In New Orleans, 42
percent of adults 25 and older had at least a bachelor’s degree in 2021
— higher than the U.S. average of 35 percent, and up from 26 percent in
2000. The overall metro area share of adults with a bachelor’s degree
grew from 23 to 34 percent — lower than the national average of 35
percent.

</div>

The share of New Orleans adults who have a bachelor’s degree has grown
across racial and ethnic groups since 1980. But while 69 percent of
White adults in New Orleans have a bachelor’s, only 23 percent of Black
adults have a bachelor’s as of 2021. The share of White adults in
Orleans Parish who have a bachelor’s degree is substantially higher than
the U.S. or metro area overall: 69 percent of White adults in New
Orleans have a bachelor’s degree while that number is 44 percent or
lower in neighboring parishes and the nation. Only 20 and 19 percent of
Black adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher in Jefferson and
St. Tammany, respectively.

The metro area increase in the share of adults with a bachelor’s degree
or higher has been coupled with a decline in the share of adults with
less than a high school degree. The proportion of adults 25 years and
older with less than a high school education declined across all three
of the largest parishes, leading to a metro-wide decrease from 15
percent in 2000 to 12 percent in 2021. In the city of New Orleans, the
share of adults with less than a high school degree fell from 25 percent
to 10 percent.

The 2021 median household income of $56,837 for the metro, $56,282 for
Jefferson Parish, and $46,942 for the city of New Orleans are
significantly lower than the U.S. median of $69,717.

In 1979, households with higher incomes were disproportionately in the
parishes surrounding New Orleans, while lower income White, Hispanic,
and Black households were more likely to live in the city.[^6] By 2021,
these patterns had changed with higher income White households more
often living in the city such that income disparity within the city has
escalated. In 2021, Black households in New Orleans had a median income
of only $30,292, while Hispanic households were at $60,358 and White
households at $83,727.

In 2021, Black households in New Orleans have incomes 64 percent less
than White households. In St. Tammany, Black households have a median
income of $52,849 which is 27 percent less than White households in that
parish. In Jefferson, Black households have a median income of $40,168
which is 37 percent less than White households in that parish. Hispanic
households have a median of $58,930 across the metro which is relatively
consistent across the 3 large parishes.

Internet access is an important indicator of access to information.
Studies have shown that without broadband, computer access, and
encompassing technology training services, workers and students are at a
disadvantage in the job market and education system.[^7] Only 71 percent
of households in Orleans Parish and only 76 percent of households in
Jefferson Parish are connected to the internet through a home-based
internet service, such as broadband (cable, DSL, or fiber), satellite,
or dial-up service, compared to 79 percent nationwide. St. Tammany is
above the national average at 84 percent of households connected to the
internet by a home-based service internet connection. Internet access
without a subscription refers to households that only have access
through group access locations such as school, work, a library, or
coffee shop.

An increasingly common way to access the internet is through a
smartphone or some other cellular device. While, in general, smartphone
access contributes positively to lessening the Digital Divide, having
access only through a smartphone restricts ability to fully leverage the
internet to complete common tasks such as writing and researching a
resume, registering your kids for school, analyzing data about your
neighborhood, or creating content for an internet business. In Orleans
Parish, 13 percent of households only have access through a smartphone,
compared to 11 percent nationwide.

### What is the Digital Divide?

Inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas with regard to access, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies.

## Poverty and access to vehicles {#poverty-and-access-to-vehicles}

A high share of residents living below the poverty level indicates the
economy is not providing many residents with the ability to meet their
most basic needs, including food, housing, and transportation. The
poverty rate in New Orleans decreased from 28 to 25 percent between 1999
and 2021 while the Jefferson Parish poverty rate increased from 14 to 17
percent. Across the U.S., the poverty rate increased by one percentage
point between 1999 and 2021.

<div class="highlight" markdown="1"> 

### How is poverty measured? 

The Census still uses the federal definition for poverty that was first created in 1964. The original calculations were based on studies from the early 1960s that indicated that family food costs were about one-third of a family’s budget. But housing costs have risen much faster than food costs since 1964. Also, the current calculations don’t count non-cash government aid, like Child Tax Credits or housing subsidies, as income. And they aren’t adjusted for differences in costs of living in different parts of the country. Given these limitations, the Census began publishing a Supplemental Poverty Measure that incorporates up-to-date data on regional housing costs as well as several kinds of government aid.  According to the Census, the 2020 Supplemental Poverty Rate for the U.S. was 9.1 percent. The Official Poverty Rate that same year was 11.4 percent.[^8]  The Census Bureau does not calculate Supplemental Poverty Rates for geographies smaller than the nation as a whole.[^9]
</div>

[^8] [^9] The poverty rate for Black New Orleanians spiked when the
1980s “oil bust” hit, jumping from 37% in 1979 to 42% in 1989. White New
Orleanians were not similarly affected. The poverty rate for White New
Orleanians remained at roughly 12% in 1979 and in 1989. Large
disparities in the poverty rate continue to be evident at all geographic
levels. For example, in metro New Orleans 29 percent of Black people and
19 percent of Hispanic people live in poverty compared to 11 percent of
White people and 19 percent of Asian people.[^10]

In Orleans Parish, about half of all Black children live in poverty
while 5 percent of White children are poor. In New Orleans, child
poverty rates peaked in 1989 for Black children and have fallen slightly
such that they are now virtually the same as in 1979 with one in two
Black children living in poverty in 2021. The poverty rate for White
children has declined from one in 10 children in poverty in 1979 to
about one in 50 in 2021.

Orleans Parish’s very low rate of 5 percent child poverty for White
children stands in stark contrast to the 51 percent rate for Black
children. While in Orleans, poverty rates for Black children are 10
times higher than for White children, in Jefferson Parish Black children
experience poverty at a little over 3 times higher rates than White
children – which is a disparity on par with the national average. In
metro New Orleans, 26 percent of Hispanic children live in poverty –
statistically no different from the national rate.

Post-Katrina, the share of New Orleans households without access to a
vehicle dropped from 27 percent in 2000 to 17 percent in 2021.
Nonetheless, at 17 percent, New Orleans’ share is more than twice as
high as in neighboring parishes, indicating the importance of a robust
public transportation system and comprehensive evacuation plan.

## Foreign-born population and geographic mobility {#foreign-born-population-and-geographic-mobility}

A rising foreign-born share of the population may reflect expanding
economic opportunities for both high-skilled and low-skilled
workers.[^11] That share of the population has grown in all three of the
most populous metro parishes since 2000, led by a 6.1 percentage point
gain in Jefferson Parish. By 2021, fully 13.6 percent of Jefferson
Parish population was foreign-born, similar to the U.S. share. In
Orleans Parish the foreign-born share of the population increased by 1.4
percentage points between 2000 and 2021 while St. Tammany saw a decrease
of -4.5 percentage points.

Like the foreign-born population, a rising share of the population who
moved into Orleans Parish in the past year may reflect expanding
economic opportunities. The most frequent reason people move long
distances, such as from one state to another state, is for job
opportunities.[^12] In addition, the young and well-educated are more
likely than others to move long distances.[^13] In 2021, 6 percent of
the population in Orleans Parish had moved into the parish in the past
year, up from 3 percent in 2004. Over 59 percent of the new movers into
Orleans Parish came from outside the state of Louisiana. In Jefferson
Parish, the share of the population who were new movers into the parish
was 5 percent in 2004 and has not significantly changed.

## Homeownership {#homeownership}

Homeownership rates across the U.S. have fallen since 2000 from 66 to 65
percent in 2021. Homeownership rates have held steady in St. Tammany
around 80 percent since 2000. In contrast, homeownership rates in New
Orleans have increased slightly, but remain lower than neighboring
parishes at 53 percent.

Homeownership rates among Black householders in New Orleans made
consistent progress between 1970 and 2021, increasing from 27 percent to
46 percent. Still, the difference in homeownership rates between Black
and White people in 2021 was significant, with only 46 percent of Black
householders in New Orleans owning their homes compared to 63 percent of
White householders.

Metro homeownership rates mirror national rates, with just over 65
percent of all householders owning their homes and White homeownership
rates about 27 percentage points higher than rates for Black
homeownership. This disparity is smaller in Orleans Parish, where only
63 percent of White householders own their homes. Homeownership in
St. Tammany outstrips Orleans, Jefferson, and the metro overall, with 80
percent of all householders owning their home: a rate of 61 percent for
Black householders, 84 percent for White householders, and 73 percent
for Hispanic householders.

Homeowners without a mortgage own their homes free and clear of any type
of loan. A high share of such homeowners usually indicates residents
living in the same house for long periods of time and helps shield
neighborhoods from foreclosures. The proportion of metro area homeowners
without a mortgage has increased from 35 to 43 percent between 2000 and
2021, driven by changes in Orleans and Jefferson. The share of
homeowners without a mortgage jumped from 33 to 43 percent in Orleans
and from 35 to 45 percent in Jefferson. One reason for the surge may be
that homeowners who returned after Katrina used insurance or Road Home
proceeds to pay off their mortgage principal. In fact, Orleans and
Jefferson received the first and second largest number of Road Home
Option 1 Grants among all Louisiana parishes.[^14]

## Housing costs and affordability, housing stock, and commuting {#housing-costs-and-affordability-housing-stock-and-commuting}

High housing costs can limit a region’s ability to attract and retain
the workforce essential for a healthy economy.[^15] Severe housing cost
burdens of more than 50 percent of household income indicate a serious
problem in housing affordability. In 2004, the share of severely
cost-burdened renters in New Orleans and the U.S. was 23 and 22 percent,
respectively. In the 17 years since, that share has spiked to 37 percent
in Orleans while growing to only 26 percent nationally. In Jefferson
Parish, the share of renters paying more than 50 percent of household
income on housing and utilities is 29 percent in 2021.

The share of homeowners paying more than 50 percent of household income
on their mortgage, taxes, utilities, and insurance is only 11 percent
across the metro area. There is a clear gap between the rate of housing
cost burden for renters vs. homeowners, and that gap has widened.

The surge in the share of severely cost-burdened renters in New Orleans
is reflective of the surge in the median gross rent (rent plus
utilities) in the city. From 2004 to 2021, monthly rent plus utilities
rose from $798 to $1,082 in New Orleans, a 36 percent increase after
adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, median gross rents increased 22
percent nationwide.

America’s aging housing stock represents both a potential problem and an
opportunity. Older homes are less energy-efficient and more expensive to
maintain.[^16] Moreover, research has shown that lead poisoning in
children is correlated strongly with residing in pre-1950 homes.[^17]
Conversely, in New Orleans, many older homes are protected by
preservation laws that have helped retain the historic character of the
city.

In Orleans Parish, fully 38 percent of all housing units are in pre-1950
structures. Meanwhile, in Jefferson Parish, 72 percent of the housing
stock was built in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and just 20
percent of housing stock has been built since 1990. In contrast, in
St. Tammany, the majority of housing units are in structures that have
been built since 1990.

A metro region is partially defined by the commuting patterns of its
residents. Commuting has been studied more and more as the costs and
burdens (physical, mental, familial, etc.) are uncovered.

Nationwide and across the New Orleans metro, there has been a sizable
increase in people working from home since the COVID-19 pandemic struck.
In New Orleans, the share working at home rose from 3 percent in 2000 to
18 percent in 2021, while the share using public transportation declined
sharply from 13 percent in 2000 to 4 percent in 2021. Working from home
is somewhat less common in Jefferson (10 percent) and St. Tammany ()
than in New Orleans or across the nation (18 percent).

## Data Sources / Methodology {#data-sources-methodology}

Data on race/ethnicity and age is from the Census Bureau vintage 2021
population estimates and Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1). Other
demographic data is from the Census 2000 Summary File 3 (SF3) and
American Community Survey 2004, and 2021 (single-year files).

Statistical tests of significance were computed at the 95% confidence
level for all data from the American Community Survey and Census 2000
SF3. An “\*” indicates that differences between two time periods or
geographies are not significant, and therefore are the result of
sampling variability rather than real change in characteristics of the
population.

The significance tests require both estimates and their standard errors.
Standard errors for the ACS estimates were calculated using formulas
from section 7, “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical
Significance” available at:
<https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 SF3 data were calculated using formulas
from Chapter 8 of the Technical Documentation available at:
<https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2000/technical-documentation/complete-tech-docs/summary-files/sf3.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 and Census 2010 SF1 data are zero.
