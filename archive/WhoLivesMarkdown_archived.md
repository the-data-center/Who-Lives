This brief examines the most current demographic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau and identifies important trends in metro area parishes. Included are data on race and ethnicity, age, educational attainment, internet access, poverty, income, children, access to vehicles, foreign-born population, geographic mobility, homeownership, homeowners with a mortgage, housing costs and affordability, single-person households, commuting, and housing stock.
</div>

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that 1,270,399 residents were living in
metro New Orleans as of July 2018, a 7 percent increase from April
2010.\[1\] The metro area now has 95 percent of its 2000 population of
1,337,726. In this brief, we examine demographic data released by the
U.S. Census Bureau and identify important changes in metro area parishes
since 2000 (or the best benchmark available).

Race/Ethnicity {#raceethnicity}
--------------

According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 population estimates, there
are now 92,245 fewer African Americans living in New Orleans (Orleans
Parish) compared to 2000, but there are also 8,631 fewer whites.
Meanwhile, the number of Hispanics grew by 7,137 and the number of
Asians grew by 390.\[2\]

### What is Orleans Parish? 

Orleans Parish is the city of New Orleans. New Orleans and Orleans Parish are interchangeable. Their boundaries are the same, and they contain the same population. 
</div>

In Orleans Parish, the share of the 2018 population that is African
American — while lower than in 2000 when it was 67 percent — continues
to represent the majority of city residents at 59 percent. The share of
Hispanics in the city increased from 3 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in
2018; the share of Asians increased from 2 percent to 3 percent; and the
share of whites increased from 27 percent to 31 percent. Meanwhile,
Hispanic, Asian, and African American populations increased as a share
of the total population in Jefferson, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. John
the Baptist, and St. Tammany parishes, each. In fact, the number and
share of Hispanics have increased in all eight parishes in the metro
area.

The number of African Americans living in New Orleans grew every year
post-Katrina (from 2006 to 2017) but decreased for the first time
post-Katrina from 232,118 in 2017 to 231,147 in 2018.

Between 2000 and 2018, the number of Hispanics in Jefferson Parish
increased by 32,081 reaching over 15 percent of the total parish
population. Orleans Parish and St. Tammany Parish gained 7,137 and
10,074 Hispanics, respectively, such that the Hispanic share of the
population was 6 percent in Orleans and 6 percent in St. Tammany in
2018.

As of July 2018, there were 114,295 Hispanics in the metro area,
representing 9 percent of the metro population. This is up from 2000
when there were 58,545, representing 4 percent of the metro population.
Despite these recent gains, the Hispanic share of the population in
metro area parishes is far below the average for the United States,
which has grown from 12 percent to 18 percent of the total U.S.
population over these 18 years.

The number of Hispanics in New Orleans metro has grown every year since
2006. Indeed while the overall metro population has grown 7 percent
since 2010, the Hispanic population has grown 22 percent such that
Hispanics account for 25 percent of the metro’s population growth since
2010.

Hispanic is an umbrella term comprising multiple nationalities and
ethnicities. Researchers have shown that most Hispanics prefer to
identify by nationality rather than by pan-ethnic terms such as
“Hispanic” and “Latino.”\[3\] The nationalities of Hispanics residing in
metro New Orleans is quite distinct from the national Hispanic profile.

In 2018, the largest Hispanic group in metro New Orleans was Honduran,
representing 33 percent of the Hispanic population. In comparison,
Hondurans represent only 2 percent of the national Hispanic population.
These figures point to metro New Orleans as a hub of Honduran migration.

Not to be ignored, the Mexican population represents 21 percent of the
Hispanic population in metro New Orleans. Nevertheless, the Mexican
population is much less prominent in the metro than nationally, where it
represents 62 percent of the Hispanic population.

Population by age and household types {#population-by-age-and-household-types}
-------------------------------------

The progression of the baby boomers through the age groups, along with
falling birth rates, have brought massive changes to the metro — and
indeed the whole country — with many more changes yet to come.\[4\]
Looking at the total population in the metro by five-year age groups for
2000 and 2018, the baby boomers are like a demographic tidal wave.
Consequently, the median age of the metro has risen to 38 in 2018 from
34.8 in 2000.

Meanwhile, the share of households with children is shrinking while the
share of individuals living alone is growing — both across the metro and
nation. As of 2017, 24 percent of households in metro New Orleans
included children, down from 34 percent in 2000. Between 2000 and 2017,
the percent of St. Tammany households with children declined from 40
percent to 29 percent; the percent of Jefferson households with children
declined from 33 percent to 24 percent; and the percent of Orleans
households with children declined from 30 percent to 18 percent.

As households with children have declined, the share of single-person
households has grown in the metro and nationwide. The metro area share
of individuals living alone grew from 27 percent in 2000 to 34 percent
in 2017 — similar to the trend for Jefferson Parish. The increase was
larger in Orleans Parish, which jumped from 33 to 46 percent.

While the metro has regained much of the post-Katrina population losses,
youth population is substantially lower than pre-Katrina levels. The
metro had 358,092 children under 18 years in 2000 and only 282,246 in
2018. Much of this loss was driven by Orleans Parish, where the under 18
population declined to 78,086 from 129,408. The under 18 population is
now 22 percent of the metro population, down from 27 percent in 2000.

### Where is data for Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. James, St. Charles, and St. John the Baptist?

Although race/ethnicity and age data is available for all eight parishes in metro New Orleans, most other demographic data (such as educational attainment, poverty, and homeownership) is available for only the three most populous parishes of Jefferson, Orleans, and St. Tammany, as well as the metro.
</div>

Educational attainment, income, and internet access {#educational-attainment-income-and-internet-access}
---------------------------------------------------

Educational attainment is an important determinant of household incomes,
workforce skills, and regional resiliency.\[5\] The proportion of adults
25 years and older with less than a high school education declined
across all three of the largest parishes, leading to a metrowide
decrease from 15 percent in 2000 to 13 percent in 2017. In the city of
New Orleans, the share of adults with less than a high school degree
fell from 25 percent to 14 percent but is still higher than the U.S.
average of 12 percent.

</div>

The metro area decline in the share of adults with less than a high
school degree has been coupled with an increase in the share with a
bachelor’s degree or higher. In New Orleans, 35 percent of adults 25 and
older had a college degree in 2017 — higher than the U.S. average of 32
percent, and up from 26 percent in 2000. The overall metro area share of
adults with a bachelor’s degree grew from 23 to 30 percent — lower than
the national average.

The 2017 median household income of $36,999 for the city of New Orleans
is significantly lower than the U.S. median of $60,336. Indeed, New
Orleans’ median household income has fallen 5 percent since 1999, after
adjusting for inflation. In Jefferson Parish, median household income
declined 7 percent between 1999 and 2017,, falling to $51,494.

</div>

Internet access is an important indicator of access to information.
Studies have shown that without broadband, computer access, and
encompassing technology training services, workers and students are at a
disadvantage in the job market and education system.\[6\] Only 60
percent of households in Orleans Parish and only 66 percent of
households in Jefferson Parish are connected to the Internet through a
home-based internet service, such as broadband (cable, DSL, or fiber),
satellite, or dial-up service, compared to 73 percent nationwide.
St. Tammany is above the national average at 78 percent of households
connected to the Internet by a home-based service internet connection.
Internet access without a subscription refers to households who only
have access through group access locations such as school, work, a
library, or coffee shop.

An increasingly common way to access the Internet is through a
smartphone or some other cellular device. While, in general, smartphone
access contributes positively to lessening the Digital Divide, having
access only through a smartphone restricts ability to fully leverage the
Internet to complete common tasks such as writing and researching a
resume, registering your kids for school, analyzing data about your
neighborhood, or creating content for an internet business. 15 percent
of households in Orleans Parish only have access through a smartphone.
This is compared to 11 percent nationwide.

<div class="highlight" markdown="1"> 

### What is the Digital Divide?

Inequalities between individuals, households, businesses, or geographic areas with regard to access, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies.

Poverty and access to vehicles {#poverty-and-access-to-vehicles}
------------------------------

Individuals living below the poverty level indicate the economy is not
providing all residents with the ability to meet their most basic needs,
including food, housing, and transportation. The poverty rate in New
Orleans is statistically unchanged comparing 1999 to 2017. Meanwhile,
the Jefferson Parish poverty rate increased from 14 to 17 percent
between 1999 and 2017. Across the U.S., the poverty rate increased from
12 to 13 percent between 1999 and 2017.

Like the overall poverty rate, the child poverty rate in New Orleans is
statistically unchanged from 1999. In Jefferson Parish, the child
poverty rate jumped from 20 percent in 1999 to 28 percent in 2017 —
greatly surpassing the U.S. child poverty rate, which rose from 17 to 18
percent between 1999 and 2017.

Post-Katrina, the share of New Orleans households without access to a
vehicle dropped from 27 percent in 2000 to 19 percent in 2017.
Nonetheless, at 19 percent, New Orleans’ share is more than twice as
high as in neighboring parishes and the nation, indicating the
importance of a robust public transportation system and comprehensive
evacuation plan.

</div>

Foreign-born population and geographic mobility {#foreign-born-population-and-geographic-mobility}
-----------------------------------------------

A rising foreign-born share of the population may reflect expanding
economic opportunities for both high-skilled and low-skilled
workers.\[7\] That share of the population has grown in all three of the
most populous metro parishes since 2000, led by a 5.4 percentage point
gain in Jefferson Parish. By 2017, fully 12.9 percent of Jefferson
Parish population was foreign-born, statistically the same as the U.S.
share. In Orleans Parish the foreign-born share of the population
increased by 1 percentage points between 2000 and 2017 while St. Tammany
Parish increased by 2.3 percentage points.

</div>

Like the foreign-born population, a rising share of the population who
moved into Orleans Parish in the past year may reflect expanding
economic opportunities. The most frequent reason people move long
distances, such as from one state to another state, is for job
opportunities.\[8\] In addition, the young and well-educated are more
likely than others to move long distances.\[9\] In 2017, 5 percent of
the population in Orleans Parish had moved into the parish in the past
year, up from 3 percent in 2004. Over 62 percent of the new movers into
Orleans Parish came from outside the state of Louisiana. In Jefferson
Parish, the share of the population who were new movers into the parish
was 5 percent in 2004, and has not significantly changed.

Homeownership {#homeownership}
-------------

Homeownership rates across the U.S. have fallen since 2000 from 66 to 64
percent in 2017. Homeownership rates have decreased slightly in
St. Tammany from 80 percent to 77 and in Jefferson from 64 to 62 percent
between 2000 and 2017. In contrast, homeownership rates in New Orleans
have held steady, but at a much lower 47 percent.

</div>

Homeowners without a mortgage own their homes free and clear of any type
of loan. A high share of such homeowners usually indicates residents
living in the same house for long periods of time and helps shield
neighborhoods from foreclosures. The proportion of metro area homeowners
without a mortgage has increased from 35 to 43 percent between 2000 and
2017, driven by changes in Orleans and Jefferson. The share of
homeowners without a mortgage jumped from 33 to 45 percent in Orleans
and from 35 to 46 percent in Jefferson. One reason for the surge may be
that homeowners who returned after Katrina used insurance or Road Home
proceeds to pay off their mortgage principal. In fact, Orleans and
Jefferson received the first and second largest number of Road Home
Option 1 grants among all Louisiana parishes.\[10\]

Housing costs and affordability, housing stock, and commuting {#housing-costs-and-affordability-housing-stock-and-commuting}
-------------------------------------------------------------

High housing costs can limit a region’s ability to attract and retain
the workforce essential for a healthy economy.\[11\] Severe housing cost
burdens of more than 50 percent of household income indicate a serious
problem in housing affordability. In 2004, the share of severely
cost-burdened renters in New Orleans and the U.S. was 24 percent. In the
13 years since, that share has spiked to 38 percent in Orleans while
rising to only 25 percent nationally. In Jefferson Parish, the share of
renters paying more than 50 percent of household income on housing and
utilities is 26 percent in 2017.

The share of homeowners paying more than 50 percent of household income
on their mortgage, taxes, utilities, and insurance is virtually
unchanged in metro area parishes since 2004. There is a clear gap
between the rate of housing cost burden for renters vs. homeowners, and
that gap has widened.

The surge in the share of severely cost-burdened renters in New Orleans
is reflective of the surge in the median gross rent (rent plus
utilities) in the city. From 2004 to 2017, monthly rent plus utilities
rose from $742 to $962 in New Orleans, a 30 percent increase after
adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, median gross rents increased 19
percent metrowide compared to only 11 percent nationwide.

America’s aging housing stock represents both a potential problem and an
opportunity. Older homes are less energy-efficient and more expensive to
maintain.\[12\] Moreover, research has shown that lead poisoning in
children is correlated strongly with residing in pre-1950 homes.\[13\]
Conversely, in New Orleans, many older homes are protected by
preservation laws that have helped retain the historic character of the
city.

In Orleans Parish, fully 41 percent of all housing units are in pre-1950
structures. Meanwhile, in Jefferson Parish, 74 percent of the housing
stock was built in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and just 18
percent of housing stock has been built since 1990. In contrast, in
St. Tammany, the majority of housing units are in structures that have
been built since 1990.

A metro region is partially defined by the commuting patterns of its
residents. Commuting has been studied more and more as the costs and
burdens (physical, mental, familial, etc.) are uncovered. In addition,
studies have shown that younger generations are less likely to drive
cars, more likely to bike, and more likely to move into urban
cores.\[14\]

The share of commuters in New Orleans using public transportation
declined sharply from 13 percent in 2000 to 6 percent in 2017, while the
share in Jefferson Parish has fallen from 2 percent in 2000, to 1
percent of commuters using public transportation in 2017. But the share
of bike commuters in New Orleans rose to 3 percent, giving the city the
fifth highest share of bike commuting of the largest 70 cities
nationwide.\[15\] Meanwhile, the metro share of carpoolers fell from 15
percent in 2000 to 9 percent in 2017, as did the Orleans Parish share
from 16 percent to 9 percent.

The percentage of workers who commute by driving alone has increased
within the metro region since 2000 from 73 percent to 78 percent, driven
by a 60 to 67 percent rise in Orleans Parish. This goes against the
national trend, where the share in driving alone remained steady between
2000 and 2017 and where public transit use has also remained steady.

Data Sources / Methodology {#data-sources-methodology}
--------------------------

Data on race/ethnicity and age is from the Census Bureau vintage 2017
population estimates and Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1). Other
demographic data is from the Census 2000 Summary File 3 (SF3) and
American Community Survey 2004, and 2018 (single-year files).

Statistical tests of significance were computed at the 95% confidence
level for all data from the American Community Survey and Census 2000
SF3. An “\*” indicates that differences between two time periods or
geographies are not significant, and therefore are the result of
sampling variability rather than real change in characteristics of the
population.

The significance tests require both estimates and their standard errors.
Standard errors for the ACS estimates were calculated using formulas
from section 7, “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical
Significance” available at:
<https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 SF3 data were calculated using formulas
from Chapter 8 of the Technical Documentation available at:
<http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2000/doc/sf3.pdf>.

Standard errors for Census 2000 and Census 2010 SF1 data are zero.

\[1\] The eight-parish New Orleans metro includes Jefferson, Orleans,
Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist,
and St. Tammany. From 2003-2012, the New Orleans metro was comprised of
7 parishes, excluding St. James. This brief has updated all 2000 metro
data to reflect an 8-parish definition, however previous versions of
this report will have used the 7-parish metro definition and
accompanying numbers.

\[2\] Throughout this brief “African American,” “Asian,” and “white”
refer to individuals who report to be only one race and not Hispanic.
However, “Hispanics” can be of any race(s). Throughout this brief,
“African American” and “black” are used interchangeably.

\[8\] Based on surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau,
employment-related reasons are the most frequent reason for inter-county
moves of greater than 50 miles. For example, among people in the United
States who moved over 500 miles, 52 percent moved for an
employment-related reason compared to 23 percent for a family-related
reason and 22 percent for a housing-related reason. Employment-related
reasons include a new job or job transfer, to look for work, to be
closer to work, retirement, and other job-related reasons. See U.S.
