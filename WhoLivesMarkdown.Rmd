This brief also covers 2023 estimates from the Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey (ACS) on a range of important topics such as educational attainment, poverty, and housing costs.   In 2023, the official definition of the New Orleans metro area changed to exclude St. Tammany. Later this year, when the Census Bureau releases 2023 ACS data, we'll publish data according to the new 7-parish metro area definition.") 
```

The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that `r comma(metropop.current)` residents were living in the 7-parish New Orleans metro as of July `r yearPEP`, a 4.5 percent decrease from April 2020.1 The metro area now has `r round.off((metropop.current / metropop.2000)*100)` percent of its 2000 population of`r comma(metropop.2000)`. In this brief, we examine demographic data released by the U.S. Census Bureau and identify important changes in metro area parishes since 2000 (or the best benchmark available). 


## Race/Ethnicity

Compared to 2000, pre-Katrina, there are now `r comma(getvalue.AA.no.2000-getvalue.AA.no.current)` fewer Black residents living in New Orleans (Orleans Parish), and there are `r comma(getvalue.white.no.2000 - getvalue.white.no.current)` fewer White residents as well as `r comma(getvalue.Hispan.no.current - getvalue.Hispan.no.2000)` more Hispanic residents.2

"### What is Orleans Parish? 

Orleans Parish is the city of New Orleans. New Orleans and Orleans Parish are interchangeable. Their boundaries are the same, and they contain the same population. "

```


In Orleans Parish, the share of the `r yearPEP` population that is Black — while lower than in 2000 when it was `r round.off((getvalue.AApct.no.2000)*100)` percent — continues to represent the majority of city residents at `r round.off((getvalue.AApct.no.current)*100)` percent. The share of Hispanic residents in the city increased from `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.no.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to`r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.no.current)*100)` percent in  `r yearPEP`; the share of Asian residents increased from `r round.off((getvalue.Asianpct.no.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off((getvalue.Asianpct.no.current)*100)` percent; and the share of White residents increased from `r round.off((getvalue.whitepct.no.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off((getvalue.whitepct.no.current)*100)` percent. Meanwhile, Hispanic, Asian, and Black populations increased as a share of the total population in Jefferson, St. Bernard, St. Charles, and St. John the Baptist parishes. In fact, the number and share of Hispanics have increased in all seven parishes in the metro area since 2000.

Between 2000 and 2023, the number of Hispanics in Jefferson Parish more than doubled – reaching `r comma(getvalue.hispan.jeff.current)` or more than `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.jeff.current)*100)` percent of the total parish population. In Orleans and St. Bernard parishes, the Hispanic population nearly doubled – growing to `r comma(getvalue.hispan.orleans.current)` (`r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.orleans.current)*100)`% of the population) in Orleans and `r comma(getvalue.hispan.bernard.current)` (`r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.bernard.current)*100)`% of the population) in St. Bernard.  The number of Hispanics St. Charles, St. John the Baptist, Plaquemines, and St. James more than doubled reaching `r comma(getvalue.hispan.charles.current)`, `r comma(getvalue.hispan.john.current)`, `r comma(getvalue.hispan.plaquemines.current)`, and `r comma(getvalue.hispan.james.current)` respectively.  

As of July`r yearPEP`, there were `r comma(getvalue.Hispan.metro.current)`Hispanics in the metro area, representing `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.metro.current)*100)` percent of the metro population. This is up from 2000 when there were `r comma(getvalue.hispanpop.metro.2000)` Hispanics, representing `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.metro.2000)*100)` percent of the metro population. Despite these recent gains, the Hispanic share of the population in metro area parishes is below the average for the United States, which has grown from `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.us.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off((getvalue.Hispanpct.us.current)*100)` percent of the total U.S. population over these `r yearPEP-2000`years.

#updated Text

The number of Hispanics in the New Orleans metro has continued to swell in recent years. From 2010 to 2020, the Hispanic population accounted for the vast majority of the metro area’s growth, increasing by `r comma(getvalue.hispangrowthCOUNT.metro.2010.2020)`, while the overall population increased by only `r comma(getvalue.growthCOUNT.metro.2010.2020)`. Since 2020, the overall metro population declined but the Hispanic population continued to grow. From 2020 to 2023, the metro area gained another `r comma(getvalue.hispangrowthCOUNT.metro.2020.current)` Hispanic residents while losing a net total of `r comma(-1*(getvalue.growthCOUNT.metro.2020.current))` residents.

Hispanic is an umbrella term comprising multiple nationalities and ethnicities. Researchers have shown that most Hispanics prefer to identify by nationality rather than by pan-ethnic terms such as “Hispanic” and “Latino.”[^3] The nationalities of Hispanics residing in metro New Orleans are quite distinct from the national Hispanic profile.

In `r year`, the largest Hispanic group in metro New Orleans was Honduran, representing `r round.off((getvalue.Hon.current)*100)` percent of the Hispanic population. In comparison, Hondurans represent only `r round.off((getvalue.Hon.us.current)*100)` percent of the national Hispanic population. These figures point to metro New Orleans as a hub of Honduran migration.

Not to be ignored, the Mexican population represents `r round.off((getvalue.Mex.current)*100)` percent of the Hispanic population in metro New Orleans. Nevertheless, the Mexican population is much less prominent in the metro than nationally, where it represents `r round.off((getvalue.MexUS.current)*100)` percent of the Hispanic population.

## Population by age and household types
The progression of the baby boomers through the age groups, along with falling birth rates, has brought massive changes to the metro — and indeed the whole country — with many more changes yet to come.[^4] Looking at the total population in the metro by five-year age groups for 2000 and `r yearPEP`, the baby boomers are like a demographic tidal wave. According to the American Community Survey, the median age of the metro has risen to `r getvalue.medage.current` in `r year` from 34.8 in 2000.

Meanwhile, the share of households with children is shrinking while the share of individuals living alone is growing — both across the metro and nation. As of `r year` ,`r round.off((getvalue.hwc.current)*100)` percent of households in Metro New Orleans included children, down from `r round.off((getvalue.hwc.2000)*100)` percent in 2000. Between 2000 and `r year`, the percent of Jefferson households with children declined from `r round.off((getvalue.hwc.Jeff.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off((getvalue.hwc.Jeff.current)*100)` percent; and the percent of Orleans households with children declined from `r round.off((getvalue.hwc.no.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off((getvalue.hwc.no.current)*100)` percent.

As households with children have declined, the share of single-person households has grown in the metro and nationwide. The metro area share of individuals living alone grew from `r round.off((getvalue.sing.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to `r round.off((getvalue.sing.current)*100)` percent in `r year` — similar to the trend for Jefferson Parish where the share of householders living alone grew from `r round.off(( getvalue.singJeff.2000)*100)` percent to `r round.off(( getvalue.singJeff.current)*100)` percent. The increase was larger in Orleans Parish, which jumped from `r round.off((getvalue.singNO.2000)*100)` to `r round.off((getvalue.singNO.current)*100)` percent.

Overall the youth population is substantially lower than pre-Katrina levels. The metro had `r comma(getvalue.under18.metro.2000)` children under 18 years in 2000 and only `r comma(getvalue.under18.metro.current)` in `r yearPEP`. More than half of this loss was driven by Orleans Parish, where the population under 18 has declined to `r comma(getvalue.under18.no.current)` from `r comma(getvalue.under18.no.2000)`. Jefferson Parish’s child population also declined from `r comma(getvalue.under18.jeff.2000)` to  `r comma(getvalue.under18.jeff.current)`. The under 18 population is now `r round.off((getvalue.pct.under18.metro.current)*100)` percent of the metro population, down from 27 percent in 2000.

## Educational attainment, income, and employment

Educational attainment is an important determinant of household incomes, workforce skills, and regional resiliency.[^4] In New Orleans, `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.nopct*100)` percent of adults 25 and older had at least a bachelor’s degree in `r year` — higher than the U.S. average of `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.USpct*100)` percent, and up from `r round.off( getvalue.bach.no.2000*100)` percent in 2000. The Jefferson Parish share of adults with a bachelor’s degree is `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.jeffpct*100)` percent up from `r round.off( getvalue.bach.jeff.2000*100)` percent in 2000. Overall the share of adults with a bachelor’s degree in Metro New Orleans from  `r round.off(getvalue.bach.metro.2000*100)`to `r round.off(getvalue.bach.metro.current*100)` percent — just short of the national average of `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.USpct*100)` percent.

But while `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.white.nopct*100)` percent of White adults in New Orleans have a bachelor’s, only `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.asian.nopct*100)` percent of Asian adults, `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.his.nopct*100)` percent of Hispanic adults, and `r round.off(getvalue.bachdeg.black.nopct*100)` percent of Black adults in New Orleans have a bachelor’s as of `r year`.

In 1979, households with higher incomes were disproportionately in the parishes surrounding New Orleans, while lower income White, Hispanic, and Black households were more likely to live in the city.5 By `r year`, these patterns had changed with higher income White households more often living in the city such that income disparity within the city has escalated.

Employment rates indicate the percent of the working age population that did any work for pay, including self-employment. Employment rates are a more comprehensive measure of labor market conditions than official “unemployment” rates, because they not only reveal the share of the population that are unemployed but also those who are no longer in the labor force at all—many of whom are “discouraged workers.”6  Employment rates by race and gender suggest the extent to which structural economic changes have benefited different groups. In New Orleans, employment rates have risen for White men and women, Hispanic men and women, and Black women compared with 1980, but for Black men are lower in `r year` at `r round.off(getvalue.blackmaleemploy.no.current*100)` percent than in 1980 when `r round.off(getvalue.blackmaleemploy.no.1980*100)` percent of working age Black men had employment.

## Poverty and access to vehicles and internet

A high share of residents living below the poverty level indicates the economy is not providing many residents with the ability to meet their most basic needs, including food, housing, and transportation. The poverty rate in New Orleans decreased from `r round.off((getvalue.pov.no.1999 )*100)` to `r round.off((getvalue.pov.no.current )*100)` percent between 1999 and `r year`while the Jefferson Parish poverty rate increased from `r round.off((getvalue.pov.jeff.1999)*100)` to `r round.off((getvalue.pov.jeff.current)*100)`percent. Across the U.S., the poverty rate increased by one percentage point between 1999 and `r year`.

"### How is poverty measured? 

The Census still uses the federal definition for poverty that was first created in 1964. The original calculations were based on studies from the early 1960s that indicated that family food costs were about one-third of a family’s budget. But housing costs have risen much faster than food costs since 1964. Also, the current calculations don’t count non-cash government aid, like Child Tax Credits or housing subsidies, as income. And they aren’t adjusted for differences in costs of living in different parts of the country. Given these limitations, the Census began publishing a Supplemental Poverty Measure that incorporates up-to-date data on regional housing costs as well as several kinds of government aid.  According to the Census, the 2020 Supplemental Poverty Rate for the U.S. was 9.1 percent. The Official Poverty Rate that same year was 11.4 percent.[^8]  The Census Bureau does not calculate Supplemental Poverty Rates for geographies smaller than the nation as a whole.[^9]"

The poverty rate for Black New Orleanians spiked when the 1980s “oil bust” hit, jumping from 37% in 1979 to 42% in 1989. White New Orleanians were not similarly affected. The poverty rate for White New Orleanians remained at roughly 12% in 1979 and in 1989. In `r year`, the poverty rate for White New Orleanians was `r round.off((getvalue.whitepov.no.current*100))` percent, while the poverty rate for Black New Orleanians had fallen to `r round.off((getvalue.blackpov.no.current*100))`% but remained about triple that of White New Orleanians.

Like the overall poverty rate, the child poverty rate in New Orleans decreased from `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.no.1999*100))`% 1999 to `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.no.current*100))`% in `r year`. In Jefferson, `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.jeff.current*100))`% of children live in poverty and across the metro `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.metro.current*100))`, both higher than the national rate.

In Orleans Parish,`r round.off((getvalue.childpov.black.nopct*100))` percent of Black children live in poverty while `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.white.nopct*100))` percent of White children are poor. In New Orleans, child poverty rates peaked in 1989 for Black children and have fallen, but, at `r round.off((getvalue.childpov.black.nopct*100))` percent, are still 10 times higher than poverty rate for White children in New Orleans. The poverty rate for White children has declined from about one in 10 children in poverty in 1979 to about one in 50 in `r year`.

Post-Katrina, the share of New Orleans households without access to a vehicle dropped from `r round.off((getvalue.veh.no.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to `r round.off((getvalue.veh.no.current)*100)` percent in `r year`. Nonetheless, at `r round.off((getvalue.veh.no.current)*100)` percent, New Orleans’ share is higher than in neighboring parishes, indicating the importance of a robust public transportation system and comprehensive evacuation plan.

Internet access is an important indicator of access to information. Studies have shown that without broadband, computer access, and encompassing technology training services, workers and students are at a disadvantage in the job market and education system.[^8] Only  `r round.off((getvalue.inta.no.current)*100)` percent of households in Orleans Parish and only `r round.off((getvalue.inta.jeff.current)*100)` percent of households in Jefferson Parish are connected to the internet through a home-based internet service, such as broadband (cable, DSL, or fiber), satellite, or dial-up service, compared to `r round.off((getvalue.inta.us.current)*100)` percent nationwide.  Internet access without a subscription refers to households that only have access through group access locations such as school, work, a library, or coffee shop. 

An increasingly common way to access the internet is through a smartphone or some other cellular device. While, in general, smartphone access contributes positively to lessening the Digital Divide, having access only through a smartphone restricts ability to fully leverage the internet to complete common tasks such as writing and researching a resume, registering your kids for school, analyzing data about your neighborhood, or creating content for an internet business. In Orleans Parish, `r round.off((getvalue.intacell.no.current)*100)` percent of households only have access through a smartphone, compared to `r round.off((getvalue.intacell.us.current)*100)` percent nationwide.

## Foreign-born population and geographic mobility

A rising foreign-born share of the population may reflect expanding economic opportunities for both high-skilled and low-skilled workers.[^9] That share of the population has grown in Orleans, Jefferson, and across the metro as whole since 2000, led by a `r round.off(((getvalue.forbor.jeff.current - getvalue.forbor.jeff.2000)*100), digits = 1)` percentage point gain in Jefferson Parish. By `r year`, fully `r round.off(((getvalue.forbor.jeff.current)*100), digits = 1)` percent of Jefferson Parish population was foreign-born, similar to the U.S. share. In Orleans Parish the foreign-born share of the population increased by `r round.off(((getvalue.forbor.no.current - getvalue.forbor.no.2000)*100), digits = 1)` percentage points between 2000 and `r year`.

Like the foreign-born population, a rising share of the population who moved into Orleans Parish in the past year may reflect expanding economic opportunities. The most frequent reason people move long distances, such as from one state to another state, is for job opportunities.[^10] In addition, the young and well-educated are more likely than others to move long distances.[^11] In `r year`, `r round.off((getvalue.mobabroadpct.no.current + getvalue.mobStatespct.no.current + getvalue.difparishpct.no.current)*100)` percent of the population in Orleans Parish had moved into the parish in the past year, up from `r round.off((getvalue.mobabroadpct.no.2004 +  getvalue.mobStatespct.no.2004 + getvalue.difparishpct.no.2004)*100)` percent in 2004. Over `r round.off((getvalue.outsidestatepct.no.current)*100)` percent of the new movers into Orleans Parish came from outside the state of Louisiana. In Jefferson Parish, the share of the population who were new movers into the parish was `r round.off((getvalue.moboutofparish.jeff.2004)*100)` percent in 2004 and has not significantly changed.

## Homeownership
Homeownership rates across the U.S. have fallen since 2000 from `r round.off((getvalue.ho.us.2000)*100)` to  `r round.off((getvalue.ho.us.current)*100)` percent in `r year`. Homeownership rates in New Orleans have increased from `r round.off((getvalue.ho.no.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to `r round.off((getvalue.ho.no.current)*100)` percent in `r year`, but remain lower than the metro as a whole where `r round.off((getvalue.homeowner.metropct)*100)` percent of households are homeowners.

Homeownership rates among Black householders in New Orleans made consistent progress between 1970 and `r year`, increasing from 27 percent to `r round.off((getvalue.homeowner.black.nopct)*100)` percent. Still, the difference in homeownership rates between Black and White people in `r year` was significant, with only `r round.off((getvalue.homeowner.black.nopct)*100)` percent of Black householders in New Orleans owning their homes compared to `r round.off((getvalue.homeowner.white.nopct)*100)` percent of White householders.

Metro homeownership rates roughly mirror national rates, with just over `r round.off(getvalue.homeowner.metropct*100)` percent of all householders owning their homes and White homeownership rates about `r (round.off(getvalue.homeowner.white.metropct*100) - round.off(getvalue.homeowner.black.metropct*100))` percentage points higher than rates for Black homeownership. This disparity is smaller in Orleans Parish, where only `r (round.off(getvalue.homeowner.white.nopct*100))` percent of White householders own their homes—`r (round.off(getvalue.homeowner.white.nopct*100)-round.off(getvalue.homeowner.black.nopct*100))` percentage points higher than Black householders. Homeownership in Jefferson outstrips Orleans with `r round.off( getvalue.ho.jeff.current*100)` percent of all householders owning their home. But this is driven by a higher White homeownership rate of `r round.off( getvalue.homeowner.white.jeffpct*100)` percent which is `r (round.off(getvalue.homeowner.white.jeffpct*100)-round.off(getvalue.homeowner.black.jeffpct*100))` percentage points higher than for Black householders in Jefferson Parish.

Homeowners without a mortgage own their homes free and clear of any type of loan. A high share of such homeowners usually indicates residents living in the same house for long periods of time and helps shield neighborhoods from foreclosures. The proportion of metro area homeowners without a mortgage has increased from `r round.off(getvalue.honomo.metro.2000*100)` to `r round.off(getvalue.honomo.metro.current*100)` percent between 2000 and `r year`, driven by changes in Orleans and Jefferson. The share of homeowners without a mortgage jumped from `r round.off(getvalue.honomo.no.2000*100)` to `r round.off(getvalue.honomo.no.current*100)` percent in Orleans and from `r round.off(getvalue.honomo.jeff.2000*100)` to `r round.off(  getvalue.honomo.jeff.current*100)` percent in Jefferson.

## Housing costs and affordability, housing stock, and commuting

High housing costs can limit a region’s ability to attract and retain the workforce essential for a healthy economy.[^12] Severe housing cost burdens of more than 50 percent of household income indicate a serious problem in housing affordability. In 2004, the share of severely cost-burdened renters in New Orleans and the U.S. was `r round.off((getvalue.rentbur.no.2004)*100)` and `r round.off((getvalue.rentbur.us.2004)*100)` percent, respectively. In the `r year-2004` years since, that share has spiked to `r round.off((getvalue.rentburpct.no.current)*100)` percent in Orleans while growing to only `r round.off((getvalue.rentburpct.us.current)*100)` percent nationally. In Jefferson Parish, the share of renters paying more than 50 percent of household income on housing and utilities is `r round.off((getvalue.rentbur.jeff.current)*100)` percent in `r year`.

The share of homeowners paying more than 50 percent of household income on their mortgage, taxes, utilities, and insurance is only `r round.off((getvalue.hobur.metro.current)*100)` percent across the metro area. There is a clear gap between the rate of housing cost burden for renters vs. homeowners, and that gap has widened.

The surge in the share of severely cost-burdened renters in New Orleans is reflective of the surge in the median gross rent (rent plus utilities) in the city. From 2004 to `r year`, monthly rent plus utilities rose from `r dollar(round.off(getvalue.medrent.no.2004))`to `r dollar(getvalue.medrent.no.current)`  in New Orleans, a `r round.off(((getvalue.medrent.no.current - getvalue.medrent.no.2004) / getvalue.medrent.no.2004)*100)`  percent increase after adjusting for inflation. Meanwhile, median gross rents increased  `r round.off(((getvalue.medrent.us.current - getvalue.medrent.us.2004) / getvalue.medrent.us.2004)*100)` percent nationwide.

America’s aging housing stock represents both a potential problem and an opportunity. Older homes are less energy-efficient and more expensive to maintain.[^13] Moreover, research has shown that lead poisoning in children is correlated strongly with residing in pre-1950 homes.[^14] Conversely, in New Orleans, many older homes are protected by preservation laws that have helped retain the historic character of the city. 

In Orleans Parish, fully `r round.off((getvalue.yrbuilt1950.nola.current)*100)` percent of all housing units are in pre-1950 structures. Meanwhile, in Jefferson Parish, `r round.off((getvalue.yrbuilt1950to1989.jeff.current)*100)` percent of the housing stock was built in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, and just `r round.off((getvalue.yrbuilt1990orlater.jeff.current)*100)` percent of housing stock has been built since 1990.

A metro region is partially defined by the commuting patterns of its residents. Nationwide and across Metro New Orleans, there has been a sizable increase in people working from home since the COVID-19 pandemic struck. In New Orleans, the share working at home rose from `r round.off((getvalue.wfh.no.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to `r round.off((getvalue.wfh.no.current)*100)` percent in `r year`, while the share using public transportation declined sharply from `r round.off((getvalue.publictransit.no.2000)*100)` percent in 2000 to `r round.off((getvalue.publictransit.no.current)*100)` percent in `r year`. Working from home is somewhat less common in Jefferson (`r round.off((getvalue.wfh.jeff.current)*100)` percent) than in New Orleans or across the nation (`r round.off((getvalue.wfh.us.current)*100)` percent).

## Data Sources / Methodology


Data on race/ethnicity and age is from the Census Bureau vintage 2023 population estimates and Census 2000 Summary File 1 (SF1). Other demographic data is from the Census 2000 Summary File 3 (SF3) and American Community Survey 2004, and `r year` (single-year files).

Statistical tests of significance were computed at the 95% confidence level for all data from the American Community Survey and Census 2000 SF3. An “*” indicates that differences between two time periods or geographies are not significant, and therefore are the result of sampling variability rather than real change in characteristics of the population.

The significance tests require both estimates and their standard errors. Standard errors for the ACS estimates were calculated using formulas from section seven, “Understanding Error and Determining Statistical Significance” available at: https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2018/acs/acs_general_handbook_2018.pdf.

Standard errors for Census 2000 SF3 data were calculated using formulas from Chapter 8 of the Technical Documentation available at: https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial/2000/technical-documentation/complete-tech-docs/summary-files/sf3.pdf.

Standard errors for Census 2000 and Census 2010 SF1 data are zero.


## Endnotes

[^1]: The eight-parish New Orleans metro includes Jefferson, Orleans, Plaquemines, St. Bernard, St. Charles, St. James, St. John the Baptist, and St. Tammany. From 2003-2012, the New Orleans metro was comprised of seven parishes, excluding St. James. In 2023, the official definition of the New Orleans metro area changed to exclude St. Tammany. Later this year, when the Census Bureau releases 2023 ACS data, we'll publish data according to the new 7-parish metro area definition which excludes St. Tammany.
